<h6>MANDERS.</h6> 
<p>

<h6>MRS. ALVING.</h6>
<p>[Drumming on the window frame.]</p> 
<p>
I ought never to have
concealed the facts of Alving's life. But at that time I dared not
do anything else--I was afraid, partly on my own account. I was such a
coward.
</p>

<h6>MANDERS.</h6>
<p>
    A coward?
</p> 

<h6>MRS. ALVING.</h6> 
<p>
If people had come to know anything, they would have
said--"Poor man! with a runaway wife, no wonder he kicks over the
traces."
</p>

<h6>MANDERS.</h6> 
<p>
    Such remarks might have been made with a certain show of right.
</p>

<h6>MRS. ALVING.</h6> 
<p>[Looking steadily at him.]</p> 
<p>
If I were what I ought to be, I
should go to Oswald and say, "Listen, my boy: your father led a vicious
life--"
</p>
<h6>MANDERS.</h6> 
<p>
Merciful heavens--!
